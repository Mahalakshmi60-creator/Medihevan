<h1 style="text-align:center; background-color:Tomato"><b>CANCER</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>What is Cancer?</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. If not treated, these cells can invade surrounding tissues and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, potentially causing severe health complications or death.</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>How Cancer develops?</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">Normal Cell Cycle: In healthy cells, the process of growth, division, and death is tightly regulated.<br>Cancer Cells: Mutations in the DNA of a cell can disrupt these controls, causing the cell to grow and divide uncontrollably. These mutations may be inherited, occur randomly, or result from exposure to carcinogens (cancer-causing agents).</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>Types of cancer</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">1.Carcinomas<br>2.Sarcomas<br>3.Leukemias<br>4.Lymphomas<br>5.Melanomas<br>6.Brain and Spinal cord tumors</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>Symptoms</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">1.Unexplained weight loss<br>2.Persistent fatigue<br>3.Pain or discomfort<br>4.Lump or swelling<br>5.Changes in skin, such as discoloration or new moles<br>6.Persistent cough or difficulty breathing<br>7.Changes in bowel or bladder habits<br>8.Unexplained bleeding or bruising</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>Diagnosis:</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">Cancer is diagnosed through various tests, including:<br>1.Imaging tests<br>2.Biopsy<br>3.Blood test<br>4.Genetic testing</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>Treatment:</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">Treatment depends on the type, stage, and location of the cancer, as well as the patientâ€™s overall health. Common options include:<br>1.Surgery<br>2.Radiation therapy<br>3.Chemotherapy<br>4.Immunotherapy<br>5.Targeted therapy<br>6.Hormone therapy</h3>
<h2 style="text-align:left; color:red"><b>Prevention:</b></h2>
<h3 style="color:white">While not all cancers can be prevented, risk reduction is possible:<br>1.Avoid tobacco and limit alcohol intake.<br>2.Maintain a healthy diet and weight.<br>3.Exercise regularly.<br>4.Protect skin from excessive UV exposure.<br>5.Get vaccinated against cancer-linked infections (e.g., HPV, hepatitis B).<br>6.Regular screenings and self-exams for early detection.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="color:white"> Early detection and treatment significantly improve outcomes for most cancers.</h3>
